    <h2 class="h3-like" id="dispute-resolution">DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND MANDATORY ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Application.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of residence or establishment is the United States. If your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Cinnabon in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this “Dispute Resolution and Mandatory Arbitration; Class Action Waiver” section (“ <strong>Dispute Resolution Section</strong>”) applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law. <strong>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process.</strong> Cinnabon is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms of Use provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this Dispute Resolution Section applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Cinnabon (described in the “Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification” section below), and if necessary, (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“ <strong>AAA</strong>”). You and Cinnabon each retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration. <br />
      <strong>Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification.</strong> At least 45 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Cinnabon each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution. You must send your notice of dispute to Cinnabon by emailing it to privacy@Cinnabon.com. Cinnabon will send its notice of dispute to the email address associated with your Cinnabon account, if any. A notice of dispute must include: the party’s name, preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 45-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at www.adr.org). <br />
      <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Cinnabon mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the Cinnabon Online Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Cinnabon agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue. </strong>
      <br />
      <strong>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement.</strong>You and Cinnabon each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as set forth in the “Governing Law and Venue” section below): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief. You and Cinnabon agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act. <br />
      <strong>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “ <strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at <a class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. In order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at <a class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA rules. <br />
      <strong>Modification to AAA Rules – Arbitration Hearing/Location.</strong> In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Cinnabon agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S. county where you reside; (b) in Atlanta, Georgia; (c) via phone or video conference; or (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator. <br />
      <strong>Modification of AAA Rules – Attorney’s Fees and Costs.</strong> Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Cinnabon will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. Either party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules. <br />
      <strong>Arbitrator’s Decision.</strong> The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. <br />
      <strong>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings.</strong> You and Cinnabon acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding. Unless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator. <br />
      <strong>Severability.</strong>Except as provided in the “No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings” section above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. <br />
      <strong> Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> If Cinnabon changes this Dispute Resolution Section after the date you last accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Cinnabon (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Cinnabon. <br />
      <strong>Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration.</strong>Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement (“ <strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>”). The Opt-Out Notice must be received within 30 days after the date you accept these Terms of Use for the first time (the “ <strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>”). In order to opt-out, you must mail (1) your full name; (2) your address (including street address, city, state, and zip/postal code); (3) the email address(es) associated with your Cinnabon account, if any; and (4) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Cinnabon through arbitration. This procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration. If you opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms of Use will continue to apply to you, including the below venue clause specifying Atlanta, Georgia. <br />
      <strong>Survival.</strong> Except as provided in the “Severability” section above, this Dispute Resolution Section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Cinnabon Online Services or terminate your Cinnabon account, if any.

    </div>
    <h3 id="governing-law">GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</h3>
    <p>These Terms of Use shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia applicable to contracts entered into and fully performed in Georgia (without regard to its conflicts of law principles that would cause the application of any other jurisdiction’s laws). Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the arbitration agreement set forth above must be brought in state or federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

    </div>
    <h3 id="miscellaneous">MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpreting these Terms of Use.</strong> Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms, conditions, policies, guidelines, standards, and in-product disclosures, these Terms of Use (including those items incorporated by reference) constitute the entire agreement between Cinnabon and you pertaining to your access to or use of the Cinnabon Online Services and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Cinnabon and you. These Terms of Use do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon anyone other than you and Cinnabon. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, except as otherwise indicated in the “No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings” section above, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. Where the word “will” is used in these Terms of Use it connotes an obligation with the same meaning as “shall.” <br />
      <strong>No Waiver.</strong> Cinnabon’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise permitted under law. <br />
      <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms of Use may not be amended, nor any obligation waived, except by Cinnabon, or with Cinnabon’s prior written authorization. Any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision thereof. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> You acknowledge that any breach of this agreement would cause Cinnabon irreparable injury, such that Cinnabon would have no adequate remedy at law. You agree that in the event of such breach, Cinnabon shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or equity, without the requirement of posting a bond.

          <strong>ELIGIBILITY.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>The Program is open only to Cinnabon account holders who are legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the District of Columbia, who are thirteen (13) years of age or older and who register for the Program through the Website or App. Minors must have parental consent. Registration is free. Any person whose access to the Website or App has been terminated or suspended by Cinnabon is NOT eligible to participate. To participate in the Program, go to the Website or download the App to your Android™ or iPhone® device and submit the information requested on the registration page and confirm your agreement to these Cinnabon Rewards Terms. Once you complete and submit all the registration information, a Program account (each, an “ <strong>Account</strong>”) will be created for you. All registration information must be completed in full. Memberships can only be used by the Member whose name is listed on the Account. You should not give your password to any other person. You are responsible for all activity in your Account and any use of your password. Limit one (1) Account per person. You cannot have more than one Account. Cinnabon may, at any time, require you to verify your name and address by means of faxing, emailing, or mailing to Cinnabon a copy of your driver’s license or other form of identification approved by Cinnabon, in addition to providing Cinnabon with a signed statement of legitimacy; and Cinnabon may automatically require such verification in the case of multiple accounts from the same address, household, computer or IP address. If you attempt to obtain more than one Account, all Points in your Account may be forfeited, and Cinnabon may, at its sole discretion, terminate your membership and permanently ban you from participating in the Program. Officers, directors and employees of Cinnabon and its parent, subsidiaries, divisions and affiliates, (each, a “ <strong>Program Entity</strong>,” and collectively, the “ <strong>Program Entities</strong>”) may participate in the Program but may not be allowed to redeem Points for certain Rewards and may otherwise be subject to restrictions that do not generally apply to how Points are earned or used. Additional or different eligibility criteria may apply to certain opportunities to earn or use Points and other invitations made by the Program Entities or their business partners. The Program is provided to individuals only. Corporations, associations, or other groups may not participate in the Program. It will be considered fraudulent for any individual, company, club, association or group to use or to direct, encourage, or allow other persons to use a single Account for the purpose of accumulating or aggregating Points for combined use, unless such use is expressly permitted by Cinnabon. Participation in the Program constitutes each Member’s permission for the Program Entities to use the Member’s first and last name, username, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements, address (city and state) and a description of any Rewards won and any other personal characteristics for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed, in perpetuity, without further compensation.

          <strong>EARNING POINTS AND REWARDS.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Members have many ways to earn Points and Rewards in the Program. The Program may also award more than one type or “class” of Points. The number of Points and the type or “class” of Points that can be earned by participating in any opportunity to earn Points will be disclosed when the opportunity is presented. Some of the ways Members can earn Points and Rewards may include the following (subject to change): </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Signing Up for a Program Account</strong>
          <br /> You can earn a Reward by completing and submitting your registration information for an Account via the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Purchasing Cinnabon Products at Participating Cinnabon Locations</strong>
          <br /> You can earn Points by visiting participating Cinnabon retail stores in the United States and purchasing Cinnabon products ((pre-tax, after applicable discounts and fees, including Groupon or any other third party programs, rounded down to the nearest dollar) or by placing an order via the App or the Website at participating Cinnabon retail stores in the United States on dine-in, carry-out, delivery (excluding third party delivery), or catering pick-up (excluding the purchase of gift cards)). Purchases of Cinnabon products at any Schlotzksy’s brand restaurants are not included in the Program. To earn Points, enter the phone number associated with your Account at the time of purchase or login to your Account on the Website or the App. Limit one (1) phone number per transaction (if applicable). You will receive ten (10) “Points” for each U.S. dollar spent, except during limited time promotions when Cinnabon may offer “Bonus Points” on featured products and/or services. No partial Points will be earned for purchase amounts less than one (1) U.S. dollar.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Surprise and Delight Rewards</strong>
          <br /> The Program might provide Members with the opportunity to earn special surprise and delight Points and/or Rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Birthday Rewards</strong>
          <br /> The Program might provide Members with a special quantity of Points or a Reward on or around their birthday of record that was provided to Cinnabon during the Account set-up (“ <strong>Birthday Reward</strong>”). Once your birthday is set in your Account profile, it cannot be changed. To receive a Birthday Reward, you must have an Account at least ten (10) days before your birthday and meet certain minimum Points requirements, as determined by Cinnabon in its sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Opt-in to Promotional Communications</strong>

        <p id="points-rewards">
          <strong>POINTS AND REWARDS REDEMPTION.</strong>
        </p>
        <p> Members may redeem Points for products, discounts, coupons, merchandise, and other rewards as determined by Cinnabon in its sole discretion (each, a “ <strong>Reward</strong>”). Points and/or Rewards may expire if not used by a date specified by Cinnabon. A service fee of $0.35 and sales tax will be charged on each Reward redemption via the Website or App. In-store redemption of a Reward is not subject to the service fee, but sales or other local tax may be imposed as required by law. You may view your current earned Points or earned Rewards and their expiration date by logging into your Account. The expiration date for Points, if any, will be disclosed when the Points earning opportunity is presented and may vary for different categories of Points. Cinnabon, in its sole discretion, may impose a limit on the number of Points or Rewards in the aggregate or by type that may earned or redeemed per Account, per day, per Reward or per any other generally-applicable metric that may be selected by Cinnabon from time to time in its sole discretion. Points are not valid on the same transaction that earned the Points and are valid on the next store visit only as determined by Cinnabon in its sole discretion. </p>
        <p> Rewards are subject to availability as determined by Cinnabon in its sole discretion. The expiration date for a Reward, if any, will be disclosed when the Reward is presented and may vary for different categories of Rewards. Cinnabon reserves the right to modify, amend or revise the Rewards available. Members may not rely on continued Reward availability. The number of Points required to redeem any Reward may be substantially increased, any Reward may be withdrawn, and restrictions and other terms and conditions associated with any Reward or its redemption may be imposed by Cinnabon or its designee or the third party business partner supplying the Reward. Rewards are non-assignable and non-transferable and may not be bartered or sold. Any Rewards assigned, transferred, bartered, or sold in violation of these Cinnabon Rewards Terms may be confiscated or cancelled. Physical Rewards (if any) will be shipped only to the United States address currently on file with Cinnabon for the applicable Member’s Account and will not be shipped to any other person or address. A pattern of redeeming Points for Rewards preceded or followed by changing the address, email address or telephone number for the applicable Account may be viewed as redemption fraud and could result in the termination of your membership in the Program. Cinnabon reserves the right to substitute Rewards of comparable or greater value if any redeemed Reward becomes unavailable for any reason. Unless otherwise specified at the time of redemption, physical Rewards (if any) will be fulfilled within six to eight weeks from date of redemption. Rewards pictured in point-of-sale, online, television and print advertising, promotional packaging, and other Program materials are for illustrative purposes only. The actual Reward may vary from the Reward pictured. </p>
        <p> All details and restrictions of the Rewards not specified at the time the redemption opportunity is presented will be determined by Cinnabon in its sole discretion. Members shall be solely responsible for all federal, state, and/or local taxes including, without limitation, income taxes and any reporting consequences thereof in connection with a Reward. If required by law, as determined by Cinnabon in its sole discretion, Cinnabon reserves the right to withhold and remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the amount of any taxes due.</p>
        <p>Points and Rewards have no cash value and may not be redeemed for cash and may not be sold, auctioned, bartered, brokered, purchased, transferred, assigned, or used to engage in any gambling activity. Any Points or Rewards obtained in this manner by any person or entity will be considered to have been fraudulently obtained and deemed void and such Points and Rewards may be confiscated or cancelled. Points and Rewards must be redeemed in accordance with these Cinnabon Reward Terms. Points and Rewards will not be replaced, reissued, or credited if lost, stolen, or otherwise altered or destroyed. If the Program includes tiers that provide the Member with benefits based on meeting a stated minimum threshold number of Points (each such tier, if any, referred to as “ <strong>Points Level</strong>”), you should know that Points Levels are subject to change. Cinnabon, in its sole discretion and without notice to you, reserves the right to change, modify, withdraw, or cancel any Points Level. Cinnabon also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine and modify, at any time, the value of Points and the number of Points or the type of Reward that may be earned for any given activity. Points and Rewards cannot be used in combination with any other discount, coupon or offer unless specifically allowed by the terms of a specific promotion. Once you have redeemed your Points or Rewards, they are gone and there are no refunds, returns or exchanges for additional Points, Rewards, cash, or other goods and services, even if you return the products, merchandise or other item(s) that your Points or Rewards were redeemed toward. </p>

          <strong>MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Cinnabon may modify any of these Cinnabon Rewards Terms, including, but not limited to, the methods through which Points or Rewards can be earned, how Points or Rewards can be used, the types or “classes” of Points available, and the conditions under which Points or Rewards may expire or be forfeited, at any time, with or without notice, even though these changes may affect a Member's ability to use the Points or Rewards that the Member has already earned. The Program has no predetermined termination date and may continue until such time as Cinnabon decides to terminate the Program. Cinnabon may, in its sole discretion, modify or terminate the Program, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason or no reason at all, with notice on the Website, in the App and/or via email to the Member’s email address currently on file with Cinnabon for their Account.</p>
        <p>If Cinnabon amends these Rewards Terms, it will revise the “last updated” date located at the top of these Cinnabon Rewards Terms. For changes to these Cinnabon Rewards Terms that Cinnabon considers to be material, Cinnabon may place a notice in the App or Website by revising the link on the home page to read substantially as “Updated Cinnabon Rewards Terms and Conditions” for an amount of time that we determine in our discretion. If you continue to participate in the Program by earning Points or Rewards, redeeming Points or Rewards, logging onto your Account or in any other way after these Cinnabon Rewards Terms have been changed, you will be deemed to have read, understood and unconditionally consented to and agreed to such changes. The most current version of these Cinnabon Rewards Terms will be available on the Website and will supersede all previous versions of these Cinnabon Rewards Terms.</p>
        <p> If Cinnabon decides in its sole discretion to discontinue the Program, Members will have approximately thirty (30) days or an amount of time deemed reasonable by Cinnabon in its sole discretion from the date Program termination is announced to use their remaining Points or Rewards. Use of any remaining Points or Rewards will be on a first come, first serve basis and otherwise subject to the availability of Rewards. Members may not rely on continued Points or Reward availability. Cinnabon makes no representation or warranty about the number or type of Rewards that may be available after Program termination has been announced, and many Rewards that may have been available prior to termination will quickly become depleted or otherwise unavailable once the Program termination has been announce. Any Points or Rewards remaining in a Member's Account at the time of termination will be forfeited and no compensation will be provided. Cinnabon may cancel your membership, cancel accumulated Points or Rewards, alter the number of Points or Rewards in your Account or suspend your membership privileges at any time with immediate effect if Cinnabon determines in its sole discretion that you (a) have acted in a manner inconsistent with applicable laws or ordinances; (b) acted in a fraudulent or abusive manner; (c) breached any of these Cinnabon Rewards Terms; (d) engaged in any fraud or abuse concerning Points or Rewards, Points/Rewards usage or Points/Rewards redemption; or (e) engaged in any conduct or act that causes Cinnabon to terminate or suspend your access to your Account. Cinnabon may also take appropriate administrative or legal action if any of the items listed above occurs. Nothing contained in these Cinnabon Rewards Terms shall limit Cinnabon in its exercise of any legal or equitable rights or remedies. </p>
        <p>Cinnabon reserves the right to terminate the membership of any Member whose Account becomes dormant. An Account will be considered dormant if the Account holder fails to log onto his or her Account for twelve (12) months or with such regularity deemed sufficient by Cinnabon and announced from time to time on the Website. Cinnabon in its sole discretion may allow Members to prevent their Points from expiring by following Cinnabon's instructions.</p>

        <p>ACCRUED POINTS AND REWARDS DO NOT CONSTITUTE PROPERTY OF A MEMBER AND HAVE NO VALUE OUTSIDE OF THE PROGRAM. POINTS AND REWARDS ARE CREDITS THAT CINNABON MAY REVOKE AT ANY TIME AS SET FORTH HEREIN. POINTS AND REWARDS ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE UPON DEATH, AS PART OF A DOMESTIC RELATIONS MATTER OR OTHERWISE. Each Member is responsible for ensuring that the information in the Member’s Account is accurate and is kept current. If a Member believes that the Member’s Account does not properly reflect Points or Rewards earned from engaging in any activities, the Member must contact Cinnabon to resolve the issue. Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Program may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Cinnabon reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Cinnabon's failure to enforce any of these Cinnabon Rewards Terms shall not constitute a waiver of the affected provision, or any other provision. All questions or disputes regarding an individual’s eligibility for the Program, the earning, crediting or use of Points or Rewards, or a Member’s compliance with these Cinnabon Rewards Terms will be resolved by Cinnabon in its sole discretion. </p>

        <strong>Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Application.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of residence or establishment is the United States. If your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Cinnabon in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this “Dispute Resolution and Mandatory Arbitration; Class Action Waiver” section (“ <strong>Dispute Resolution Section</strong>”) applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law. <br />
        <strong>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process.</strong> Cinnabon is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms of Use provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this Dispute Resolution Section applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Cinnabon (described in the “Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification” section below), and if necessary, (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“ <strong>AAA</strong>”). You and Cinnabon each retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration. <br />
        <strong>Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification.</strong> At least 45 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Cinnabon each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution. You must send your notice of dispute to Cinnabon by emailing it to <a href="mailto:privacy@cinnabon.com">privacy@cinnabon.com</a>. Cinnabon will send its notice of dispute to the email address associated with your Cinnabon account, if any. A notice of dispute must include: the party’s name, preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 45-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at <a class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand for Arbitration Consumer Arbitration Rules.pdf">www.adr.org</a>) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at <a class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>). <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Cinnabon mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the Cinnabon Online Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Cinnabon agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue. </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement.</strong> You and Cinnabon each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as set forth in the “Governing Law and Venue” section below): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief. You and Cinnabon agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act. <br />
        <strong>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “ <strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at <a class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. In order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at <a class="fcs-third-party" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA rules. <br />
        <strong> Modification to AAA Rules – Arbitration Hearing/Location.</strong>In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Cinnabon agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S. county where you reside; (b) in Atlanta, Georgia; (c) via phone or video conference; or (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator. <br />
        <strong>Modification of AAA Rules – Attorney’s Fees and Costs.</strong> Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Cinnabon will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. Either party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules. <br />
        <strong>Arbitrator’s Decision.</strong>The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. <br />
        <strong>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings.</strong> You and Cinnabon acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding. Unless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator. <br />
        <strong>Severability.</strong> Except as provided in the “No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings” section above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. <br />
        <strong>Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> If Cinnabon changes this Dispute Resolution Section after the date you last accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is effective. Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Cinnabon (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Cinnabon. <br />
        <strong>Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement (“ <strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>”). The Opt-Out Notice must be received within 30 days after the date you accept these Terms of Use for the first time (the “ <strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>”). In order to opt-out, you must mail (1) your full name; (2) your address (including street address, city, state, and zip/postal code); (3) the email address(es) associated with your Cinnabon account, if any; and (4) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Cinnabon through arbitration. This procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration. If you opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms of Use will continue to apply to you, including the below venue clause specifying Atlanta, Georgia. <br />
        <strong>Survival.</strong> Except as provided in the “Severability” section above, this Dispute Resolution Section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Cinnabon Online Services (as defined in the Terms) or terminate your Cinnabon account, if any.
